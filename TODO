WNF (weather normalization factor)
-> uses perf/calc
=> need to use same constants/assumptions as perf for the baseline

wnf.Score(rho, vw) => assume baselines
= iterate over baseline conditions and computer wnf.Calc and then average

Polyline (directions/bearings)
wnf.Calc(<climb, including db>, rho, vw, dw) => % slower

"unit score" for rho + wind

unit climb: 5km 8% grade at sea level (ie/ all one way)
unit TT: 10mi 0% flat TT out-and-back (ie/ 5mi one direction, 5mi in other)
directions: headwind, tailwind, crosswind (hw/tw should be same for TT)
compare to baseline (sea level rho0, no wind)
***TODO use different cda for TT than climb!
= average of 6 (5 unique) values percentage compared to baseline

score:  ideally want multiplier on time = 1.12 = 12% faster than baseline day

also: wWatts and wWatts%
